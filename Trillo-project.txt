TRILLO PROJECT USING ADVANCED CSS.

FLEXBOX

. Frexbox is a new module in CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to one another
in different directions and orders.

. The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to expand 
and to shrink elements to best use all the available space;

. Flexbox replaces float layouts, using less, and more readable and logical code;

. Flexbox completely changes the way that we build one-dimensional layouts;

. A true revolution in CSS!
